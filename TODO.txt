Features by priority:

- fix My parcels tab to show NFTs owned by the user (both parcels and proposals) when he is connected with his wallet
- make it so each parcel is minted as an NFT upon "Load Parcel Data" being clicked, but only if it doesn't already exist. When they are minted, they should be placed randomly in the wallets of the users. The users's wallets should be the ones we have generated from the seed phrase.
- Create a "Proposals and Offers" panel, which shows all the proposals and offers for the selected parcels
- Once Load Parcel Data is clicked, and after generating parcels and displaying them is completed, parse all parcels and silently mint NFTs in the background for those that do not have an NFT attached. Set the owner a random address out of five addresses provided in .env
- Check bounties
- Deploy the project to an EVM blockchain
- Deploy the project to Vercel or some such service
- figure out the initial setup for demo purposes. Do we use hardhat-generated HD wallet and import into Metamask? Do we use the Metamask seed phrase in hardhat? Do we use Metamask public addresses in minting parcel NFTs? (seems to make most sense). Do we have a setup page where user can enter 5 or so of his own Metamask addresses?
- fix Load Parcel Data so that roads are parcels correctly (low priority)
- add Owner to parcel cards in the Parcels panel. Owner should be the blockhain address that owns the parcel NFT.

- City Treasury
- Current Market Value: $0.008 (we'll use Uniswap dex for this)
